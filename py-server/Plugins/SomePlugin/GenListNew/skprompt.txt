Given an array of reviews for a product, filter out all repetitive, low quality reviews. DO NOT filter out quality reviews describing product features and user experience. If there is no low-quality review, include all. The result should have no more than 10 reviews. Include an array of the index of the included and excluded reviews.

Respond ONLY with a JSON object with the following format:

Result: {
  //filtered reviews
  reviews: [],
  //index of included reviews
  included: [],
  //index of excluded reviews
  excluded: []
}

Reviews: {{$reviews}}
