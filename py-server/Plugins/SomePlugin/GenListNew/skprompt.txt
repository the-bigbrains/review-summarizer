Given an array of reviews for a product, filter out all repetitive, low quality reviews. DO NOT filter out quality reviews describing product features and user experience. If there is no low-quality review, include all. The result should have no more than 10 reviews. Include an array of the index of the included reviews.

Respond ONLY with a JSON object with the following format:
{
  //filtered reviews
  reviews: ["review1", "review2", "review3"],
  //index of included reviews
  included: [0,3,5],
}

Reviews: {{$reviews}}
